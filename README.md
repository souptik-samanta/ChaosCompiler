##  Design

- **CoreXY** 
- ~+ an *unknown flavor* of Z-axis (letâ€™s just call it *Cartesian-ish* ðŸ’€)~
- ~So yeahâ€¦ itâ€™s a **Cortesian XYZ**~
---

##  Features

- Fully **automatic multicolor printing** (thanks to a DIY MMU)
- **Auto print removal** for that sweet hands-free experience

---

##  Thought Process

I went *as cheap as humanly possible*, sourcing *everything* within India :indiaparrot:.  
Spoiler alert: **India is expensive af** when it comes to hobby electronics.  
So instead of buying multiple machines and racking up costs, I said, "*What if... I go wild and build a full-on tool exchanger?*"

##  The Crazy Part

I donâ€™t even know how I stayed this dedicated.

We're talking:
- **75+ hours**
- **Multiple mood swings** (per day ig?)
- Learning **both Cartesian and CoreXY** systems  
(because why suffer once when you can suffer *twice*, right?)  
- Debugging, rebuilding, doubting my life choices, and then doing it again  
Maybe mood swings are underrated ðŸ˜­  
They made me **learn two motion systems at once**.  
10/10 would emotionally spiral again :dance_catgirl:

## TL;DR

I built a **CoreXY-Cartesian hybrid 3D printer**  
with **manual tool changing**, **automatic multicolor**, and **auto eject**,  
all on a budget, in India,  
from scratch,  
by myself,  
with caffeine, breakdowns, and vibes
