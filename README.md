:thought_balloon:  thought:

Went as cheap as possible, sourcing everything within India :indiaparrot: (spoiler: India is expensive af ).
 Instead of buying multiple machines,and adding costs. I went wild and built a tool exchanger .

crazy part

I don‚Äôt even know how I stayed this dedicated.
 I put in a stack(64)+ hours, mood swings and all.
 Learned both Cartesian and CoreXY systems (because why suffer once when you can suffer twice, right?)
 Maybe mood swings are actually underrated üò≠(I love mood swings :dance_catgirl: help me learn two things at onceee)
